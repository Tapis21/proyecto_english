                <h2>Early Childhood (0–5 years old)</h2>
                <p>I was born on November 27th, 2005. From what my family tells me, I was a very curious baby — always observing everything around me, always trying to understand what was going on.</p>
                <p>These early years were full of love, protection, and many discoveries. I learned to walk, to talk, and to start building connections with the world.</p>
                <p>Even though I don’t remember everything, those first steps are the roots of who I am today.</p>

                <h2>Childhood (6–11 years old)</h2>
                <p>These were some of the most magical years of my life. School became an important part of my daily routine, and I started making my first real friends.</p>
                <p>I remember having a lot of imagination — I could turn anything into a game.</p>
                <p>I was learning not just from books, but also how to share, how to express myself, and how to understand others.</p>
                <p>In this section, I will show pictures that represent moments and experiences that made me happy during those years.</p>
