      <h2>Childhood</h2>
      <p>When I was a baby, I slept a lot and ate a lot.<br>
      My family took me to RÃ­o Lagartos beach.<br>
      I don't remember much, but I think I was happy.</p>

      <h2>Key Moments</h2>
      <p>A big moment for me was starting university. I was happy and a little scared.<br>
      I also helped with a school event. I learned teamwork and responsibility.<br>
      I also made my first project in App Inventor. I was very proud of it.</p>
